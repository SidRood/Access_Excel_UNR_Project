# Access_Excel_UNR_Project
I completed this project at the University of Nevada, Reno. I have been working with Access and Excel and this includes three parts. The first part was focused on creating the database design and ERD's to initially map out the entities, attributes, and relations.
The second part has a few simple query designs and an additional table where all of the populated data was linked from a cleaned excel file. In the excel file, I was given an abundance of data and had to use various functions to organize the data in order to import it successfully.
The third part, I created many queries including aggregate, parameter, and update.
